Preprocessing: The dataset is transformed into features that can be used by the regression model. This includes encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical variables, and creating new features.

Web deployment: The model is deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. The user can input the features of a house and the model will output a predicted housing price. The user can also visualize the data used for training and testing the model.
